# CS 225 Data Structures 
# Team Contract 
Communication 
  1. Team Meetings: Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday up until the Mid-Project Checklin on April 23 from 4pm to 5pm. 
    After the deadline, we will meet twice a week at a to be determined time. We will meet over Discord. 
  2. Assistance: We have set up a Discord server for routine conversation. Alternatively, we could communicate over email. We 
    expect the quickness of response to be around a couple hours or less.
  3. Respect: As a team, we will help to ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak, listen, and be respected by 
    messaging team members were they to miss a meeting about the project. If a member does not feel their voice is being heard, 
    they can express their ideas in the Discord chat as well.
Collaboration 
  1. Work Distribution: We each do an equal amount of work concerning the project. Unexpected complications and/or unforeseen        work will be done together.
  2. Time Commitment: About 4-5 hours of work is expected of each group member. If we find that one or more members are not 
    meeting regularly or committing enough time to the project, we will take notice and message them.
  3. Conflict Resolution: If there is a disagreement between members of the team, we will let the third person of the group 
    outside of the disagreement decide.
